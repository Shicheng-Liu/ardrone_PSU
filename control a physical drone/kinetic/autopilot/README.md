How to make the ardrone2 recognize the environment and autopilot

<br> Now, attention! This stuff is much cooler than keyboard control.
<br> Please make sure that you have followed the keyboard control tutorial and finished successfully before you work on this project because

How to work on this project

<br> First, download the workspace _catkin_ws_ in your home directory. Since the core package _tum_ardrone_ we need to use in this project
 only has indigo version and is hard to install in kinetic, I will not give you the steps of installing the package. You just 
  download my worksapce _catkin_ws_ and everything will be fine.
