ROS kinetic to control
==
<br>
Here, we can use ROS kinetic to do lots of fancy stuff.
<br> I will put several projects in sequence. Please, follow the order.
<br> First, we will turn to [keyboard control]
(https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/parrot_PSU/tree/master/control%20a%20physical%20drone/kinetic/keyboard%20control) which is cool and easy to handle.
