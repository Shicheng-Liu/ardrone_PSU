=======
Here, I document my works about Parrot drones. 
<br>The Parrot company has developed an awesome controller called [Olympe](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/olympe/). If you want to explore how to use Olympe, you can find what you want in [Shulace's repository](https://github.com/shulace13/parrot_PSU).
<br> This repository records works on Ardrone2, a parrot drone which cannot be supported by Olympe.
<br> Here, I provide several methods of simulating Ardrone2 and controlling a real Ardrone.
<br> If you cannot wait to use the Ardrone in the lab, you can [get started quikly](https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/parrot_PSU/tree/master/control%20a%20physical%20drone) and have some fun.
