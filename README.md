Here, we document our works about Parrot drones. 
<br>The Parrot company has developed an awesome controller called Olympe. If you want to explore how to use Olympe, you can find what you want in Shulace's repository.
<br> This repository records works on Ardrone2, a parrot drone which cannot be supported by Olympe.
